# Open MCT 3D Model Viewer

This plugin displays a 3D model in Open MCT. During development of this plugin the Open MCT software was still undergoing some changes so the description may not work. I try to keep the description up to date. If you encounter problems feel free to create an issue. 

## Getting Started

1. From the root directory of Open MCT clone this repository in any directory of your liking. In this description we will use ./example/

`git clone https://github.com/Xnaff/openmct-3d-model-viewer.git`

2. Register the plugin in ./src/defaultRegistry.js "In the documentation of Open MCT ther should be a bundles.json this json file is missing. I created an issue in Open MCT about it"
